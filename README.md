# Implementing a Basic Unix Shell

## Goals
This repository is intended to provide a guide to implementing a basic Unix shell. It covers the basics and sets up the stage for adding more complex features.
Future articles will add features and improve the shell's functionality.

A Makefile has been provided to easily compile the shell and any example programs. 
Adding more example programs is as easy as adding the source file to the `progs/` directory. The Makefile takes care of the rest!
