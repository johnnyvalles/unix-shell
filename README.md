# Implementing a Basic Unix Shell

## Goals
This repository is intended to provide a shell implementation that outlines the basics required in building a more complex shell. 
Future articles within this repository
will add features and improve the shell's functionality.

A Makefile has been provided to easily compile the shell and any example programs. 
Adding more example programs is as easy as simply adding the source file to the `progs/` directory. The Makefile takes care of the rest!
